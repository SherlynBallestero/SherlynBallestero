Hello! 👋 My name is Sherlyn Ballestero 😊.  
Here are some things about me:

🌍 I was born in Cuba, but I am currently living in New Mexico, USA.  
🎓 I started my studies at the University of Havana, where I began to love this field. I am now continuing my education in Computer Science at Park University.  
💻 I am passionate about programming, learning, research, robotics, and mathematics.  
🚗 Every time I have the opportunity, I try to go on a road trip, learning more about culture and natural wonders, and enjoying the beautiful landscapes.  
📚 I am always trying to learn new skills and broaden my knowledge. Whether it's through online courses, reading books, or hands-on projects, I am constantly seeking opportunities to grow and improve.  
🌱 I believe that continuous learning is key to personal and professional development, and I am committed to making it a lifelong journey.  
💪 I firmly believe that the only way to overcome goals in life, whether physical or mental, is through effort and dedication. I am convinced that we can all achieve the results we set for ourselves if we fight for them with determination.  
🎯 For me, it is crucial to set a clear objective and move in that direction, knowing that making mistakes is a fundamental part of the process.  
🤖 In fact, I consider failure to be one of the best things that can happen to us because, just like in reinforcement learning in artificial intelligence, errors and failed attempts are essential to improve and optimize our performance over time.
